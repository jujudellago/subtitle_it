00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:45,557
My dear children,

2
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:50,550
it is now better than several years
since l moved to New York

3
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:54,633
and l haven't seen you
as much as l would like to.

4
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:58,749
l hope you will come to this ceremony
of Papal honours,

5
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:01,229


6
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:06,552


7
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:09,712
More than all the money and power
on Earth.

8
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:12,795
You are my treasure.

9
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:16,430
Anthony and Mary,

10
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:21,151
although l entrusted your education to
your mother for your own best interest,

11
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:27,270
l look forward to seeing you, and to
a new period of harmony in our lives.

12
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:32,956
Perhaps you might prevail upon your
mother to come to this celebration,

13
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:38,240
and that from time to time, we can all
see each other at family functions.

14
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:43,716
Anyway, l remain your loving father.

15
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:15,358
Hail Mary, full of grace...

16
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:21,272
...blessed art Thou amongst women...

17
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:24,910
...and blessed is the fruit of Thy womb,
Jesus.

18
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:29,468
Holy Mary, mother of God,
pray for us sinners...

19
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:59,071
Almighty God, bless the insignia
of Saint Sebastian the Martyr,

20
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:05,270
that it may contribute to the sacredness
of him to whom it is given.

21
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:24,233
Do you, Michael, promise to be faithful
to the noble purposes of this Order,

22
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:28,791
to have a special care for the poor,
the needy and those who are ill?

23
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:30,757
l do so promise.

24
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:48,438
May the blessing of Almighty God,

25
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:53,355
Father, Son and Holy Spirit

26
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:58,674
descend upon you
and remain with you forever.

27
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:31,597
Vincent, our name is not on the list.

28
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:36,318
Write it in. Mancini. M-A-N-C-l-N-l.

29
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:41,234
- Problem?
- My name isn't on the list.

30
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:46,030
- Then you have to leave immediately.
- You want to dance with me?

31
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:48,714
Joe, it's Vinnie. These are our guests.

32
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:51,519
l'm sorry. l'm sorry, sir.

33
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:53,830
Welcome to the party.

34
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:48,319

35
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:51,074
- Sit down.

36
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:56,515
The Order of Saint Sebastian is one of
the highest honours the Church awards.

37
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:58,716
lt was first granted by Pope...

38
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:02,190
What about Mr Corleone's connections
with gambling?

39
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:04,431
The press kits have...

40
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:08,195
- And involvement with the underworld?
- Cut the crap.
